## About Me

I am a fourth year undergraduate student from the School of Software, Jiangxi Agricultural University. Before that, I used to work with Prof.  Yingqiong Peng .

Now I am actively applying for phd in the United States. If you are interested in my research experience, I hope to receive your email!

The scientific research projects I participated in at the university focused on using artificial intelligence to assist farmers in agricultural production. For example, I led the team to develop the "Sericulture Assisted Decision-making" software to provide "crop pest identification and management" services; using and optimizing three-dimensional reconstruction such as Nerf algorithms technology to better characterize and identify crops.

My future research interests are in combining artificial intelligence technology with human-computer interaction (HCI) and virtual reality (VR).

At the same time, I am an active open source player. I am happy to share the papers I read and use my technology to complete some products of practical significance. I have currently published 96 technical articles on the CSDN platform, and received 66,794 total visits, and 3,609 fans support my blog; at the same time, I also share some teaching videos on computer vision and paper sharing videos at Station B, and have achieved The total views are 32,879, and 409 fans support my video.

At the same time, I also started a business when I was a sophomore, mainly providing customers with simple data processing, data mining, image recognition and other technical services based on third-party platforms. This had a great impact on my life and career planning.

I'm always looking for a balance between life and work
In my spare time, I am keen on mountain climbing, marathon and other outdoor activities.
As a guitarist, I will record many songs when I feel inspired.

Why did I choose to pursue a PhD?
I want to be able to use artificial intelligence technology with a group of ambitious people in the future to develop a product that can better serve human life. This means that I need to have relatively high technical capabilities and a more cutting-edge technological vision.
